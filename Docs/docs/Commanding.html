<p><strong>Commanding</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commanding is the same as normal prism Commands.&nbsp; Some of the standard commands will be handled by default in the AppCanApp base class.&nbsp; Those can be overridden if desired.&nbsp; An example of the commanding can be seen by looking at the Samples\SimpleApp</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open, Save, SaveAs, Close standard commands are handled.&nbsp; AppCan adds AppCanCommands which at the moment includes an Exit command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future ideas:</strong></p>
<p>Future thoughts on commanding would be to support an AppCan command that can take a context name and it would create that context.&nbsp; This would allow creating a window directly through a command from a context.</p>
