<p><strong>Region Managers</strong></p>
<p>In Prism there is one region manager with a global region name space that is used for everything.</p>
<p>In AppCan you can have local region managers for each Context.&nbsp; You can also have the view for a region created from a different context (This is useful to ensure there is only one IView derived class and if you have a view model one IViewModel derived
 class within a ContextDef/Context, that insures the creation logic will work properly and generically.</p>
