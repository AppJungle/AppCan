<p><strong>Samples</strong></p>
<p>This section describes the included samples.&nbsp; (These samples were modifed from their prism variants to demonstrate AppCan api usage).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HelloWorld</strong></p>
<p>This sample shows a basic Hello World app with some configuration for contextdefs and a region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=appcan&DownloadId=639483" alt="Hello World" width="1152" height="648" style="float:left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SampleApp</strong></p>
<p>This sample demonstrates:</p>
<p>Configuration</p>
<p>ContextDef/Context setup</p>
<p>Menu merging</p>
<p>Toolbars</p>
<p>Commanding</p>
<p>Models and Model Container usage examples</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>StockTrader</strong></p>
<p>(This sample is still a work in progress.&nbsp; The way this application is written still has a lot of tying of classes together through controllers, so the seperation into different contexts requires some more refactoring.)&nbsp; The tests don't run at
 the moment.</p>
<p>Still though it shows AppCan working with a little more robust of a sample.</p>
